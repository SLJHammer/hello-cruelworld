A place to sort it all out 

Hello Earthlings!

SLJHammer here. Thanks for visiting. I have no idea what I'm doing. I was looking for a way to sort the results of my web search by date instead of the random order they seem to show up. This is where I ended up...so, I'm guessing this is where you separate the men from the boys. Let's see what happens in my case. BTW, I love Earth tacos, quesadillas, coffee, donuts, and occasionally some good old skunk weed and tequila. Keeps the bugs and cobwebs cleared out.

Have a great night! ✌️😎
